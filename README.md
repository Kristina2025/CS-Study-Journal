## Day 1 - 26.11.2025
Math sudy - I completed chapter 3.5. Inequalities from Elementry and Intermediate Algebra by Jerome E. Kaufmann and Karen L. Schwitters: it was an easy chapter so I only did the odd numbered problems.
CS study - CS61a (Python): I completed the videos from lecture 3 Control. 
## Day 2 - 27.11.2025
CS Study - CS61a (Python): I did all of the exercises from Disc01. Did them on papar first, and then tested them in my IDE. I got 3 wrong though. My mistake was mostly with the starting value or the incrementation of the loops. I also completed the readings from week 1.
## Day 3 - 28.11.2025
Math study - Completed chapter 3.6. from Elementry and Intermediate Algebra by Jerome E. Kaufmann and Karen L. Schwitters.
